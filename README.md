# COIN: (C)hain (O)f (IN)terpretability

This serves as a toolkit with the aim of automatic interpretability using agents and sparse autoencoders for refined, in the loop, interpretations of neurons. This is the first step towards a pipeline of testing all of the neurons activating for a given input image and chaining the interpretations together to understand the full picture of why a network classified a target input as a specific class. 


This project combines the automation and agency of MAIA ( Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent https://github.com/multimodal-interpretability/maia) with a sparse autoencoder (SAE) for better extraction of monosemanticity from individual neurons. 

For controlled generation of synthetic data for in the loop hypothesis testing we replace the diffusion based synthetic data generator in MAIA with the Unity gaming engine for more phyiscally grounded generation.
